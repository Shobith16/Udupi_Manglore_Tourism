                         dating back to 1424 CE, King Deva Raya II of the Vijayanagara Empire visited the temple and granted land for operation.

                                Konaje Kallu is a large granite monolith. I agree this is huge. But I wonder how the British Sailors where able to see the peak of the stones from the Arabian Sea and called it as Ass's ears!

                                We, me and my Auto driver Chandrahas Shetty started climbing 2PM. We got 2 other guys there, they do their studies at Moodbidri. We were not knowing the way to go there to the top. Could see different ways in different directions. One of the villegers shown us the first direction to climb up and remaining we assumed and climbed up.
                                 Could see some trees and plants which are dried due to the lack of water.
